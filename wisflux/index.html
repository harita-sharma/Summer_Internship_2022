                <b>Basic Concepts</b>
                <p>
                    <b>Internet : </b>The Internet, sometimes called simply "the Net," is a worldwide system of computernetworks -- a network of networks in which users at any one computer can, if they havepermission, get information from any other computer (and sometimes talk directly tousers at other computers).
                    The Internet provides different online services. Some examples include: Web – acollection of billions of web pages that you can view with a web browser. Email – themost common method of sending and receiving messages online.
                     Social media – websitesand apps that allow people to share comments, photos, and videos.
                     <br>
                     <b>WWW : </b>The World Wide Web—commonly referred to as WWW, W3, or the Web—is aninterconnected system of public web pages accessible through the Internet. 
                     The Web isnot the same as the Internet: the Web is one of many applications built on top of theInternet.
                     <br>
                     <b>URL : </b>Just as buildings and houses have a street address, web pages also have unique addressesto help people locate them. On the Internet, these addresses are called URLs (UniformResource Locators).
                      <br>
                      <b>Web browser : </b>A web browser is application software for accessing the World Wide Web or a localwebsite.
                       When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the web browserretrieves the necessary content from a web server and then displays the page on theuser's device
                      <br>
                      <b>HTTPS : </b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Itis used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on theInternet.
                       In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport LayerSecurity or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer.
                      <br>
                      <b>Client side and Server side : </b>
                      <li>It is simply a service consumer. In web development, 'client side' refers to everything in aweb application that is displayed or takes place on the client (end user device).
                       Thisincludes what the user sees, such as text, images, and the rest of the UI, along with anyactions that an application performs within the user's browser.
                       </li><li>The server provides services to the client. A web server is software and hardware thatuses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to clientrequests made over the World Wide Web. 
                      The main job of a web server is to displaywebsite content through storing, processing and delivering web pages to users.</li>

                    HTML-Hypertext Markup language.
                     HTML is markup language used for making websites and describing web page layout.
                      This markup tells a web browser how to display text, images and other forms of multimedia on a web page. 
                      HTML is sometimes called a programming language but it has no logic, so is a markup language.

With the help of meta tag, you can experiment and preview that how your webpage will render on the browser.
                     The meta tag is placed within the head tag, and it can be used more than one times in a document.
